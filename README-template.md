Learn background properties. Understand the Opacity & box shadow properties.


### Useful resources

- [box-shadow](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/box-shadow/) - This helped me for box shadow properties. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [opacity](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/o/opacity/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand opacity. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
